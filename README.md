# Download

# How to use
Figure out how to run Abe's Exoddus in windowed mode.
Make sure before using the program, to go into Abe's Exoddus and create a save called "debug".
The hook will load into this save straight away.

# Build
To build, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and set environment variable *ABE_GAME_DIR* to your copy of Abes Exoddus/Oddysee.
